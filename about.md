I have a couple of nephews named Van and Luke. This site is for them.

I'm trying to pass along things that I've learned over the years that no one told me. While I ultimately believe failure is a good thing and has a lot to teach us, I want them to fail at things further down the road than I did which, in theory, will push them to greater heights. This site's purpose is to do that.
