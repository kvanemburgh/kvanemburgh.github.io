You can get anything if you put the effort in. This is a simple anticdote but very hard in practice. If you want to accomplish something, it is within your reach. You just have to practice. And continue to be persistent at practice. To the point where nothing will stop you. If you give a distracted effort, you will never become the best at it. Don’t have a “learned helplessness orientation.” If you take nothing else out of these notes, remember this.
