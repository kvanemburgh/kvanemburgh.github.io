You are more. You might fall to the level of others and start to believe you are what they think you are but you're both wrong. You are way more than that. Don't let your mind be polluted by believing what other people say about you or treat you a certain way. Be your own person, follow what drives you and keep moving forward with that in the front of your mind. You can't be stopped, you won't be stopped when you are going down your own path.
