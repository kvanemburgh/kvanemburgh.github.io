There are going to be times where the world has fallen out. You'll be so down you will think it's always going to be like this and never get better. You can feel it all through your body. I promise, things get better. Everything in life comes in waves, ups and downs. The same goes for the highs. It's not going to stay that way so be prepared to come back to earth. Enjoy in the process, the every day. That's what we have in the end.
