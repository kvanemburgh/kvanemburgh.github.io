You are not going to be good at most things when you start. That's a good thing. If it's easy, it's not worth learning. Whatever it is you find you want to do, keep at it. Keep practicing. You will get better, and as you do, you will find the results more satisfying, even if you don't end up liking the endevor. In the beginning, you will think you're terrible and not going to improve. This is what Ira Glass calls "The Gap". You know what should be good but you see your work isn't there yet. It will be though. Persist.
