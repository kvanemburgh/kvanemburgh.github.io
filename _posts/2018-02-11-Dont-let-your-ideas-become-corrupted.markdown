Your ideas are one thing that makes you original. When you have a good one, run with it. People may try to bring you back to the pack. Most don't want you to think differently then the group or get too far out of the box. That's ok. Your idea will find the right channels.

Also, don't take the shortcut when executing your ideas. As Seth Godin would say, "take the Long Cut". Make sure when you do begin to bring your idea to life, you don't shortchange it because you don't have time to do it right or it seem like too much work. It deserves to be given full effort. And if it doesn't work out, move on to the next one. The universe wasn't ready for that one yet. You have an infinite amount of ideas.
