It was said by Yoda and it still holds true. When you say "I'll try", it gives you an excuse to quite early, to not go all the way. Lot's of people want to give themselves and excuse to give up. Don't be like them, follow through with everything. Finish what you start. If you want it, don't let anything stand in your way.
