I bargained with Life for a penny,
And Life would pay no more,
However I begged at evening when
I counted my scanty store.

For Life is a just employer,
He gives you what you ask,
But once you have set the wages,
Why you must bear the task.

I worked for a menialâ€™s hire,
Only to learn dismayed,
That any wage I had asked of Life,
Life would have willingly paid
