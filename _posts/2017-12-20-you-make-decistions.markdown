From the time you wake up until you go to sleep at night you make decisions. Be mindful of what decisions you are making. Are you helping your end goals? Are you just being reactive to everything? Donâ€™t waste energy being reactive. Choose how you decide to act and decide outcomes based on adding good to the world, things good for yourself and others. The future you will thank you.
