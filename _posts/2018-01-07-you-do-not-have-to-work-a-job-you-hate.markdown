There are lots of reasons to work a job but if you hate it, quit. You can find another one. You may not like the next one much better but keep looking. You shouldn't waste any more of your time at a job you're not excited about going to. Start doing something you love on the side and keep at it until you have enough traction to leave your job. If you are at a place you love, keep going. But once you start hating it, leave and find something else. I've done this plenty of times and it seems scary once you are about to jump but opportunities come if you are paying attention. There are too many people that go through life just getting through the week for the weekend, don't be one of them.

It's fitting I'm posting this on a Sunday, the day most people are dreading going into their mundane job.
