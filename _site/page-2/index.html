          </h2>
          <p>Your ideas are one thing that makes you original. When you have a good one, run with it. People may try to bring you back to the pack. Most don’t want you to think differently then the group or get too far out of the box. That’s ok. Your idea will find the right channels.</p>

<p>Also, don’t take the shortcut when executing your ideas. As Seth Godin would say, “take the Long Cut”. Make sure when you do begin to bring your idea to life, you don’t shortchange it because you don’t have time to do it right or it seem like too much work. It deserves to be given full effort. And if it doesn’t work out, move on to the next one. The universe wasn’t ready for that one yet. You have an infinite amount of ideas.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>You can get anything if you put the effort in. This is a simple anticdote but very hard in practice. If you want to accomplish something, it is within your reach. You just have to practice. And continue to be persistent at practice. To the point where nothing will stop you. If you give a distracted effort, you will never become the best at it. Don’t have a “learned helplessness orientation.” If you take nothing else out of these notes, remember this.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>Everything can fall down around you but if you keep your body in good shape, you can recover. You don’t have to go to the gym everyday, just get outside and run, do pushups, lunges, anything you can. There will be a lot of things that try to get in the way of this, ignore them. Your body is the most important thing.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>Whenever you do something, ask yourself “is this putting more good or bad in the world”. Show kindness to people, even the ones you don’t think deserve it. Help others, be honest, show humility. We need more good things happening, be part of that change.</p>
