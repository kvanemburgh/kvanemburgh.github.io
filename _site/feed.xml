&lt;p&gt;Also, don’t take the shortcut when executing your ideas. As Seth Godin would say, “take the Long Cut”. Make sure when you do begin to bring your idea to life, you don’t shortchange it because you don’t have time to do it right or it seem like too much work. It deserves to be given full effort. And if it doesn’t work out, move on to the next one. The universe wasn’t ready for that one yet.
