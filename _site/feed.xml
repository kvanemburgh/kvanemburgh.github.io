And Life would pay no more,
However I begged at evening when
I counted my scanty store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Life is a just employer,
He gives you what you ask,
But once you have set the wages,
Why you must bear the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked for a menial’s hire,
Only to learn dismayed,
That any wage I had asked of Life,
Life would have willingly paid&lt;/p&gt;
