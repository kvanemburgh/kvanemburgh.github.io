          </h2>
          <p>The most effective networking strategy has nothing to do with conferences, cocktail hours, cold emails, or any of the common ideas you hear.</p>

<p>1) Do interesting things.<br />
2) Share them publicly.</p>

<p>Repeat those two strategies and you’ll become a magnet. Like-minded people will come to you.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>Success is hard. Every force in the world is working against you. Persist. And leave the haters behind. The people that tell you you can’t do it and run you down for trying will certainly exist. They are wrong. Don’t stop moving forward.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>I bargained with Life for a penny,
And Life would pay no more,
However I begged at evening when
I counted my scanty store.</p>

<p>For Life is a just employer,
He gives you what you ask,
But once you have set the wages,
Why you must bear the task.</p>

<p>I worked for a menial’s hire,
Only to learn dismayed,
That any wage I had asked of Life,
Life would have willingly paid</p>

          </h2>
          <p>Make sure you fail a lot. The more you fail, the more you refine the process and it gets sharpened. Keep failing, keep learing from it. It’s easy to get discouraged as you fail, but the more you go through it, the more experience you gain and you will start to see results that you’re proud of.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>Someone can read more than you, memorize more facts or have a higher degree, but no one can beat the person who learns from passion. The person who doesn’t give up and is always pushing towards their dreams. Don’t be intimidated by someone who is “book smart”, you’re more driven.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>Your ideas are one thing that makes you original. When you have a good one, run with it. People may try to bring you back to the pack. Most don’t want you to think differently then the group or get too far out of the box. That’s ok. Your idea will find the right channels.</p>

<p>Also, don’t take the shortcut when executing your ideas. As Seth Godin would say, “take the Long Cut”. Make sure when you do begin to bring your idea to life, you don’t shortchange it because you don’t have time to do it right or it seem like too much work. It deserves to be given full effort. And if it doesn’t work out, move on to the next one. The universe wasn’t ready for that one yet. You have an infinite amount of ideas.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>You can get anything if you put the effort in. This is a simple anticdote but very hard in practice. If you want to accomplish something, it is within your reach. You just have to practice. And continue to be persistent at practice. To the point where nothing will stop you. If you give a distracted effort, you will never become the best at it. Don’t have a “learned helplessness orientation.” If you take nothing else out of these notes, remember this.</p>
