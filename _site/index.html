          </h2>
          <p>You can get anything if you put the effort in. This is a simple anticdote but very hard in practice. If you want to accomplish something, it is within your reach. You just have to practice. And continue to be persistent at practice. To the point where nothing will stop you. If you give a distracted effort, you will never become the best at it. Don’t have a “learned helplessness orientation.” If you take nothing else out of these notes, remember this.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>Everything can fall down around you but if you keep your body in good shape, you can recover. You don’t have to go to the gym everyday, just get outside and run, do pushups, lunges, anything you can. There will be a lot of things that try to get in the way of this, ignore them. Your body is the most important thing.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>Whenever you do something, ask yourself “is this putting more good or bad in the world”. Show kindness to people, even the ones you don’t think deserve it. Help others, be honest, show humility. We need more good things happening, be part of that change.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>It was said by Yoda and it still holds true. When you say “I’ll try”, it gives you an excuse to quite early, to not go all the way. Lot’s of people want to give themselves and excuse to give up. Don’t be like them, follow through with everything. Finish what you start. If you want it, don’t let anything stand in your way.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>There are lots of reasons to work a job but if you hate it, quit. You can find another one. You may not like the next one much better but keep looking. You shouldn’t waste any more of your time at a job you’re not excited about going to. Start doing something you love on the side and keep at it until you have enough traction to leave your job. If you are at a place you love, keep going. But once you start hating it, leave and find something else. I’ve done this plenty of times and it seems scary once you are about to jump but opportunities come if you are paying attention. There are too many people that go through life just getting through the week for the weekend, don’t be one of them.</p>

<p>It’s fitting I’m posting this on a Sunday, the day most people are dreading going into their mundane job.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>You are not going to be good at most things when you start. That’s a good thing. If it’s easy, it’s not worth learning. Whatever it is you find you want to do, keep at it. Keep practicing. You will get better, and as you do, you will find the results more satisfying, even if you don’t end up liking the endevor. In the beginning, you will think you’re terrible and not going to improve. This is what Ira Glass calls “The Gap”. You know what should be good but you see your work isn’t there yet. It will be though. Persist.</p>

          <p>If you are waiting for the right time to do something it will never get done. The time is never right, there is no perfect opportunity. You just have to go for it. If you want to make it happen, it has to happen when the circumstances aren’t just right. Because they never will be.</p>

          <p>There are going to be times where the world has fallen out. You’ll be so down you will think it’s always going to be like this and never get better. You can feel it all through your body. I promise, things get better. Everything in life comes in waves, ups and downs. The same goes for the highs. It’s not going to stay that way so be prepared to come back to earth. Enjoy in the process, the every day. That’s what we have in the end.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>You are more. You might fall to the level of others and start to believe you are what they think you are but you’re both wrong. You are way more than that. Don’t let your mind be polluted by believing what other people say about you or treat you a certain way. Be your own person, follow what drives you and keep moving forward with that in the front of your mind. You can’t be stopped, you won’t be stopped when you are going down your own path.</p>

          <p>Most people fail to realize that they get to choose their stage, who they will be, and how they will act. They have not decided to write the story of their own lives, but instead have given the storytelling to someone or something outside of them or their control.</p>

          <p>Surround yourself with people who make you a better person.</p>

<p>You want people who push you, make you stronger and get you out of your comfort zone. People that only make you feel good will hurt you in the long run and not help you to be better or push boundaries.</p>

          <p>Our comfort zone is where we are safe in life. Our real self is everything beyond that.</p>

<p>The Curiosity Zone is bigger than the Comfort Zone.</p>

<p>Every time you are curious, you punch another hole in that comfort zone.</p>

          <p>From the time you wake up until you go to sleep at night you make decisions. Be mindful of what decisions you are making. Are you helping your end goals? Are you just being reactive to everything? Don’t waste energy being reactive. Choose how you decide to act and decide outcomes based on adding good to the world, things good for yourself and others. The future you will thank you.</p>
